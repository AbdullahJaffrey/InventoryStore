# Welcome to the React Inventory Project!

This project is a web application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The purpose of this project is to create a simple inventory management system where users can manage and track their inventory of products.

## Features
* Product Listing: View a list of products currently in the inventory.
* Add Product: Add new products to the inventory.
* Edit Product: Update the information on existing products
* Delete Product: Remove products from the inventory.

## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

The first step is to create a folder 

``` mkdir folder-name ```

To select that folder, run this command

``` cd folder-name ```

Vite will assist you in creating a React.jsx application.

``` npm create vite@latest ```

Select ```React```

Then, select  ```Javascript```

Select the folder using this command

``` cd vite-project ```

Now, Install the project dependencies by running:

``` npm install ```

## Usage

To start the application, use the following command:

``` npm run dev ``` + Press ```H``` + Press ```O```

This will launch the development server, and the application will be accessible at ```http://localhost:3000``` in your web browser.
